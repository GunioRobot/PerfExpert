Rough list of items yet to be implemented. Plan to update as items are finished or as bugs are discovered:

Currently the Perl code does:
1. Maintaining configuration constants
2. List of performance counters to measure
3. Convert the HPCToolkit file to pure XML without DTDs and other crap
4. Verify the first few lines of the file to contain standard tags (and also later through the document)
5. Parse list of metrics and map them to PerfExpert's list of metrics from (2)
6. Parse each metric line
7. If necessary, parse metrics from the second file (for diffing)
8. Sort code items by priority (percentage of total running time)
9. For each discovered metric:
  a. Ignore if relative importance is lower than threshold
  b. Compute LCPIs
  c. Print bars

Code components: [edu.utexas.tacc.perfexpert]
 - Configuration
 - Validation of input file
 - Parsers for metrics
 - Aggregation of metrics (LCPI computation)
 - Presentation
 - Logging framework
