Rough list of items yet to be implemented. Plan to update as items are finished or as bugs are discovered:

Steps in the Perl code, with status of migration to Java:
[DONE] 1. Maintaining configuration constants
[DONE] 2. List of performance counters to measure
[DONE] 3. Convert the HPCToolkit file to pure XML without DTDs
[PENDING] 4. Verify the first few lines of the file to contain standard tags (and also later through the document) - Need XML Schema
[DONE] 5. Parse list of metrics and map them to PerfExpert's list of metrics from (2)
[DONE] 6. Parse each metric line
[DONE] 7. If necessary, parse metrics from the second file (for diffing)
[DONE] 8. Sort code items by priority (percentage of total running time)
[DONE] 9. For each discovered metric:
  [DONE] a. Ignore if relative importance is lower than threshold
  [DONE] b. Compute LCPIs
  [DONE] c. Print bars

Code components: [edu.utexas.tacc.perfexpert]
 - Configuration
 - Validation of input file
 - Parsers for metrics
 - Presentation
 - Logging framework
