PerfExpert installation notes:


For a local (user-specific) installation:

1. Build PerfExpert:
   a. In the 'build/' directory, type in 'ant jar'
   b. Check if there is a perfexpert.jar in the 'bin/' directory
   c. Modify the PERFEXPERT_HOME variable in the perfexpert shell script to point to the root PerfExpert directory
   d. Test the PerfExpert installation by executing the shell script, it should print the usage

2. Get hpcdata.sh and related jars (from an HPCToolkit/HPCViewer installation or build it from the HPCViewer source)

3. Create a '.perfexpert' directory in ${HOME}

4. Copy/move the 'perfexpert.properties' file from your PerfExpert directory to '${HOME}/.perfexpert'

5. Modify '${HOME}/.perfexpert/perfexpert.properties' to point to the correct *absolute* paths:
   a. CONFIG_LOCATION should point to the 'config/' directory under PerfExpert dir
   b. HPCDATA_LOCATION should point to the hpcdata.sh script from step (1)

6. If required, modify the configuration files under the 'config/' to suit your cluster

7. Test the complete installation by using the sample XML files provided with PerfExpert
   $ perfexpert 0.1 sample-input.xml


For SYSADMINS:
Follow the same steps as above, the only change being in step (3), where you should move it to '/opt/apps/perfexpert'.
