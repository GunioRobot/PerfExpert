PerfExpert 2.0

Alpha code. Aimed to be an expert system that mines performance-counter-based information to identify key sections of code, which when transformed, would give the most bang-for-the-buck. Ultimately aimed to be able to apply program transformations automatically.

Currently refactoring from an existing Perl code.
